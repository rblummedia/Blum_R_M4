Demo scene: 
Minion goes to each waypoint that is stationary, then goes to the moving waypoint, then loops back to stationary. 
At the beginning of the stationary waypoints, the Minion may pause for a second, but will continue after a few seconds (this does not happen every time). 

The waypoints are colored red, with the tracker colored blue.
